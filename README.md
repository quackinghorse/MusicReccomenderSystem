# MusicReccomenderSystem
I made a music reccomender system that provides you with a web app where you can enter a song of your choice and based on certain parameter(cosine score) it gives you top 5  similar songs of the same vibe. This is made possible using spotify web api call
the dataset is taken from kaggle and can be accessed using the link-https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/notshrirang/spotify-million-song-dataset?resource=download
I have also made a web app to provide an interface to the Music Reccomender System
